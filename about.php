                        <h1>Story of our Company</h1>
                        <p>The shop started from pre-orders the owner buys her products at Divisoria. It became successful and the owner tries to sell her products at Shopee. At first it started with at least 10 orders per week until it increased to week. The owner started looking for suppliers and hired a worker that could help her. During the pandemic, the shops popularity increased and started getting more than 100 orders a week, the owner decided to get more helpers since she was pregnant during that time. As the months past the orders continue to increase from 100 to 600 orders.
                             Their space was not enough that is why they expanded their store. There they created another shop called Charms Trifted Finds. </p>
